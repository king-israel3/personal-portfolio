            <p>I'm a self-taught web developer from Nigeria with a strong focus on frontend development. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>I started my coding journey through online platforms like FreeCodeCamp, where I earned my first certificate in Responsive Web Design in Feb, 2024. Since then, I've been building, and learning â€” one project at a time.</p>

            <p>I write clean, reusable code and design with the user in mind. Outside of coding, I love exploring UI trends, improving my design sense, watching movies, playing video games and occasionally catching up on football highlights or tech YouTube channels.</p>
